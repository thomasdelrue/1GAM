===============


working title: pitch perfect?

- audio/rhythm game where the gameplay/input is the sound

- goal is to enter the right sound in time. Missing (continuously) means losing;
getting it right advances you further, gets you to the next level

- at the end of each level, you can have a playback of your 'game'/music

- first level, 2 'sounds' (and an 'empty'? aka silence). Next level, 3 sounds; ...4 sounds... etc.

- input is microphone. Possibility to use rocksmith guitar? (chords?)
- if no midi input, then keyboards/mouse for picking the right 'sounds'

- gameplay can be the right pitch... the right volume, rhythm/speed?


- begin screen, with a short music (hang) playing
- end screen?
- game screen
- settings screen


- look into DSP, pygame midi
