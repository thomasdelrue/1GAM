idea of this file, is a playbook that has all the information
about the time development in the game, what the different 
stages are, and what happens in them...

the clock of the game should keep track of the time, and in
what play of the book we're currently in.

ie Challenging and Ready stage are allotted a certain amount of time,
other stages are not, and continue as long as there are aliens on screen
during that stage...

---
and yet, this idea of a playbook might be superfluous... we shall see
later in development...
