- project 'Muse' - feb 2018

'rhythm'/platformer game

- music sheet is the platform
- goal is for the player 'cursor' to hit the notes on the music sheet
at the right time...

- music sheet 'scrolls' in time in sync with the music playing...

- like Rocksmith, different 'notes' have their own color coding...

- first try simple sheet music, like 'Fr√®re Jacques...'
- first get *timing* of 'scrolling' right!!. When it's time for a
    note to 'hit', it should consistenly be displayed at the 'now'
    point on the screen (where the player cursor will be)
